# Deep Q Learning
A Reinforcement Learning algorithm which strives to create a Neural Network that can predict the optimal action given the current gamestate. 

## Experience Replay
A memory for the agent which store the current state, selected action, reward, resulting state, and done flag (a boolean value describing if the game has ended).
